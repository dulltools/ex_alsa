# ALSA

ALSA stands for Advanced Linux Sound Architecture. It provides an API between
sound card device drivers and applications. Since Linux 2.6 it has been included in
the Linux kernel, replacing OSS (Open Sound System).

It's notoriously esoteric, mostly due to it's poor documentation and very large API.
That said, it provides a number of a nice features that allow for _easier_ configuration
with the sound card and low latency interaction.

## Frames, ring buffers, periods and more

## How does ALSA work?

## What are xruns, underruns and overruns?

## Where do JACK/Pulseaudio/Pipewire fit?

## How low latency can I really get with Linux?
